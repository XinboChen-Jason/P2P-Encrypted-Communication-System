# P2P-Encrypted-Communication-System

Hi everyone, I just moved this project from my personal space to Github.
This project was designed to develop a point to point communication system, no central server needed, you can directly reach anyone on the internet with there IP and port(port map required) if they are 'visible'.
It is a weekend project. Therefore, a limited time will be dedicated. I split this project into several stages:
  1. TCP or UDP communication under LAN-Local Area Network.
     
     source code upload   ServerDemo.java ClientDemo.java
     
     Run these code in two separate consoles in Eclipse or command line.
     
  2. TCP communication under WAN-Wide Area Network, a central server required in this stage to help clients to find each other.     
  3. Implement P2P technology, then clients can find others without a central server.
  4. Implement encrypt technology.
  




Update 2018-09-30:
  Stage one was finished before this project moved to Github, the source code has been upload.
  Currently working on stage two.
  Stage three is very hard, when I get there I will try my best to figure it out.
