# P2P-Encrypted-Communication-System

Hi every one, I just moved this project from my personal space to github.
This project was designed to develope a point to point comminication system, no central server needed, you can directly reach anyone on the internet with there ip and port(port map required) if they are 'visable'.
It is a weekend project. Therefore, a limited time will be dedicated. I split this project into several stages:
  1. TCP or UDP communication under LAN-Local Area Network.
     source code upload   ServerDemo.java ClientDemo.java
     Run these code in two seperate console in Eclipse or command line.
  2. TCP communication under WAN-Wide Area Network, a central sever reqired in this stage to help clients to find each other.     
  3. Implement P2P technology, then clients can find others without a central server.
  




Update 2018-09-30:
  Stage one was finished before this project moved to Github, the source code has been upload.
  Currently working on stage two.
  Stage three is very hard, when I get there I will try my best to figure it out.
